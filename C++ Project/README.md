# System of Linear Equations Solver using LU Decomposition
The project is a simple C++ Solver for a System of Linear Equations, using LU Decomposition. This method includes decomposing a square matrix into  the product of a lower-triangular and an upper-triangular matrix. After carrying out this decomposition, we can obtain a the solution array by simple forward-substitution followed by a backward substitution. This is one of the simplest ways to obtain the result for a system of linear equations.

## Requirements
The project has been compiled using 'g++' during its development, and hence it is neede to run the files. Furthermore, the project has been developed on a Linux Kernel (OS: Fedora 35), hence it might need some supervision when running on other kernels.
