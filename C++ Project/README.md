# System of Linear Equations Solver using LU Decomposition
The project is a simple C++ Solver for a System of Linear Equations, using LU Decomposition. This method includes decomposing a square matrix into  the product of a lower-triangular and an upper-triangular matrix. After carrying out this decomposition, we can obtain a the solution array by simple forward-substitution followed by a backward substitution. This is one of the simplest ways to obtain the result for a system of linear equations.
